This week, I've been completely captivated by the explosion of AI art online. Scrolling through various platforms, I'm constantly amazed by the sheer variety and often breathtaking beauty of the images being generated. From photorealistic portraits of imagined beings to abstract landscapes that defy description, it feels like a whole new world of visual expression has been unlocked. It sparks so many questions about authorship, originality, and the very definition of art in the digital age. I even tried my hand at prompting some images myself, and the process was surprisingly intuitive, yet also felt a little like magic.
